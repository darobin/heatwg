      <h2 id="mission">Mission</h2>
      <p>
         Web technology has grown without paying much attention to digital advertising, and
         conversely ad technology has evolved without paying much heed to the fundamentals of Web
         architecture. This mutual ignorance has been the source of growing tension. The mission of
         the HEAT WG is to resolve these tensions, make advertising a first-class citizen of the
         Web, and to design advertising technology as Web technology. The end goal is for the Web to
         be the best advertising platform that it can be, and better than any other.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2 id="bg">Background</h2>
      <p>
        Digital advertising is a key business model that supports the production of content on the
        Web and subsidises access to it. As an advertising context, the Web has a solid foundation.
        It is an environment designed for <em>trust</em>, and a trustworthy environment is a good
        one to advertise in.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, however, advertising has not been treated as a first-class citizen on the
        Web, and as a result the system of digital advertising that developed as a sidecar to the
        Web sits uncomfortably with the Web's overall architecture and with the expectations of its
        users.
      </p>
      <p>
        This has led to substantial tension. Digital advertising is largely done adversarially with
        respect to users, with lip service paid to dubious notions of control or consent and too
        often a cavalier approach to users' computing resources and privacy. The current system is
        also failing to provide a sustainable business model for publishers to create quality
        content and is proving inefficient for advertisers, much of whose money is lost to fraud as
        well as opaque layers of intermediation and arbitrage. Broad sharing of data has been
        associated not just with privacy issues, but has also been identified as a key factor
        leading to market concentration.
      </p>
      <p>
        The scale of the Web, of advertising, and of what rides on both makes this set of issues
        challenging. We can, however, fix this, and that is what the HEAT WG is tasked with
        accomplishing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Web can, and does, support multiple business models, but none of the alternatives have
        proven able, on their own, to make up for the shortfall that the disappearance of
        advertising would constitute. Advertising is here to stay; the question is how to implement
        it in a way that matches the Web's foundational values. The Web was designed for broad
        access, and ensuring that advertising can be a key sustainable contributor to the Web is
        entirely in line with that goal. The Web is a massive piece of infrastructure and shared
        knowledge, and advertising a key contributor to sustain it.
      </p>
      <p>
        This view of advertising comes with consequences. The first is that <em>advertising is for
        end-users</em>. Supporting the Web infrastructure serves no purpose other than to improve
        the lives of people, and that is what advertising must be for. Today's advertising ecosystem
        treats the user as an adversary, a target whose data, attention, and computing resources
        we are entitled to. This breaks the promise of trust which is at the heart of the Web.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second is that <em>advertising must be sustainable</em>. It must support and help
        improve key components of the Web. An advertising ecosystem that fails to sustain
        publishers, which is what we are seeing in today's system, is one that is poorly designed.
      </p>
      <p>
        This leads directly to a third consideration which is that <em>advertising must be
        effective</em>. The more effective it is, the less of it is needed. The more attractive it
        is to advertisers, the better we can improve Web infrastructure with limited taxation of
        attention.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, <em>such an essential system must, by its very nature, have very strong properties
        of governance and accountability</em>. Users must know how their attention is used,
        advertisers must know where their money goes, publishers must control what runs on their
        sites.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
      <p>
        The group is tasked with standardising Web technology to support a wide variety of
        advertising use cases on the Web, while maintaining privacy for users and sustainability for
        the platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        The group will only consider proposals that are thoroughly respectful of people's privacy.
        Proposals that rely on users waiving away the protection of their data are explicitly out
        of scope.
      </p>
      <p>
        In assessing whether, amongst the many potential solutions that exist in the advertising
        space, a given proposal is in scope the group must consider whether it abides by this
        priority of constituencies:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Users come first. This rules out proposals that go against overwhelming user preference
          not to have their data shared and proposals that take excessive risk with user data such
          as those built atop cross-context identifiers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Then publishers, whose production the system seeks to support. This rules out proposals
          that expect trade secrets such as audience information to be shared with other parties not
          under the direct control of the publisher, and anything that limits publisher sovereignty
          over their own digital properties.
        </li>
        <li>
          Then advertisers, whose money finance the system. This requires supporting the ability to
          optimise spend, prevent fraud, and have farm-to-table accountability on campaign
          performance.
        </li>
        <li>
          Infrastructure providers such as browser vendors and adtech intermediaries. Proposals must
          be practical, durable, and implementable.
        </li>
        <li>
          Specifiers, theoretical purity â€” no one cares.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </section>

      <h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>
      <p>
        The group is expected to work on the following specifications:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Requirements for a Healthy Ecosystem in Advertising (RHEA)</dt>
        <dd>
          This document will provide a detailed foundation explaining what a healthy ecosystem is
          for advertising. This will notably built atop the existing privacy work from the TAG and
          PING, and explain how it applies to advertising.
        </dd>
        <dt>Conversion Attribution &amp; Measurement in Private (CAMP)</dt>
        <dd>
          A set of solutions to enable privacy-preserving attribution on the Web.
        </dd>
        <dt>Sharable Private And Robust Targeting of Aggregated Cohorts at Useful Scale (SPARTACUS)</dt>
        <dd>
          Interests targeting is an important part of advertising, but it can also easily be
          leveraged against people. It has often been implemented through violations of privacy and
          by taking publisher data to monetise it elsewhere. The goal of SPARTACUS is to enable
          publishers to provide interests targeting in anonymised ad requests, as well perhaps as
          allowing (smaller) publishers to share privacy-preserving means of creating interests
          cohorts.
        </dd>
        <dt>Honest Options for the Targeting and Delivery of Anonymised Marketing (HOTDAM)</dt>
        <dd>
          This defines a set of interrelated pieces of technology to support cohort retargeting and
          anonymised ad requests. (The space occupied by FLEDGE and PARAKEET.)
        </dd>
        <dt>Safe Locally-Inlined Content (SLIC)</dt>
        <dd>
          Ads are easier to make safe if they are bundled and limited in what they can do. This is
          the bundled file format for ads.
        </dd>
        <dt>Governance of Ad Requests by a Union of Diverse Actors (GARUDA)</dt>
        <dd>
          To the extent that HOTDAM relies on a trusted server, it will need a governance model to
          ensure that it is indeed trustworthy. This specification will develop that model in full.
        </dd>
        <dt>Advertising Capabilities for Direct Campaigns (ACDC)</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            Buying directly from publishers is an effective way to cut out wasteful spending on
            intermediaries, but it requires the publisher to be large enough to have a direct sales
            operation and advertisers to want to go directly to publishers. For small businesses, it
            is often easier to buy inventory from a large self-serve platform than from a handful of
            local publishers, even though the latter might be more effective.
          </p>
          <p>
            An API with which to buy campaigns directly from a publisher, exposed at a predictable
            <code>.well-known</code> endpoint, would provide a step forward in this direction.
            Standardising an API means that products could be created by independent companies to buy
            directly from publishers, and to set up campaigns easily across multiple publishers (eg.
            all the papers in the county).
          </p>
        </dd>
        <!--
          Open question: do we want to specify some form of Unified Tracking Protection that is how
          all browsers protect privacy (at a minimum)?
